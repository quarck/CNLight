As part of normal operation, this app receives and stores information about events fired by Android Calendar

No such information ever leaves application: 

 * it is not transmitted anywhere

 * not shared with anyone

 * not provided to any 3rd party 

After event is dismissed, its infromation is stored in the Bin for a number of days (default 3), and 
after expiration - information is completely removed. 

Bin can be disabled, in such case information about event is removed from the app as soon as event 
is dismissed. 

Application contains functionality of keeping logs in a persistent storage for debug purpose, this 
functionality is off by default and can only be enabled through hidden developers menu.
